```

Initial analysis and some data visualization.
```{r}

#What's the distribution of the obstacles?
ninja_warrior %>%

Are there obstacles that are more common during qualifying vs final rounds? Use Tidylo (tidy log odds) package!
```{r}
ninja_warrior %>%
  filter(round_stage %in% c("Qualifying", "Finals")) %>%
  count(round_stage, obstacle_name, sort = TRUE) %>%
  bind_log_odds(round_stage, obstacle_name, n) %>%
  arrange(desc(log_odds_weighted)) %>%
  filter(round_stage == "Finals") %>%
  top_n(16, abs(log_odds_weighted)) %>%
  mutate(obstacle_name = fct_reorder(obstacle_name, log_odds_weighted)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(log_odds_weighted, obstacle_name)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(x = "More/less likely to in finals",
       y = "",
       title = "Liklihood of various Ninja Warrior obstacles appearing in finals") +
  theme_fivethirtyeight() +
  theme(text = element_text(family = "Times New Roman"),
        axis.title = element_text())
```
